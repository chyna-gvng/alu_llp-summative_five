# AfriCO-X Project Report

## Problem Identification
Africa faces significant challenges in monetizing carbon reduction efforts due to limited access to global carbon markets. Traditional carbon credit trading systems are often centralized, opaque, and inaccessible to smaller projects.

## Solution Design
AfriCO-X leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, decentralized platform for carbon credit trading. The solution consists of three main smart contracts:

1. CarbonCreditToken (CCT)
```solidity
contract CarbonCreditToken is ERC20, Ownable {
    constructor(address initialOwner) 
        ERC20("CarbonCreditToken", "CCT") 
        Ownable(initialOwner) {}
    
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
}
```
This contract implements the ERC-20 standard for tokenized carbon credits, with controlled minting by the platform owner.

2. ProjectRegistration
```solidity
contract ProjectRegistration is Ownable {
    struct Project {
        string name;
        string details;
        bool verified;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Project) public projects;
}
```
Manages the submission and verification of carbon reduction projects.

3. Governance
```solidity
contract Governance is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    function voteForProject(uint256 _id) public nonReentrant {
        require(cctToken.balanceOf(msg.sender) > 0, "Must hold CCT to vote");
        // Voting logic
    }
}
```
Implements DAO-based decision making for project approval.

## Implementation Process

1. Smart Contract Development
- Utilized OpenZeppelin contracts for security
- Implemented reentrancy protection
- Added events for important state changes

2. Testing
- Developed comprehensive test suite
- Verified on local Ganache network
- Deployed to Sepolia testnet

3. Security Measures
- Access control patterns
- Reentrancy protection
- Standard audited implementations

## Results and Validation
- Successfully deployed on Sepolia testnet
- All test cases passing
- Security measures validated

## Future Improvements
1. Layer 2 scaling implementation
2. Enhanced verification mechanisms
3. Integration with carbon credit standards

## Conclusion
AfriCO-X successfully demonstrates how blockchain technology can democratize carbon credit trading while ensuring transparency and security.
